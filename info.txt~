Workflow

dataFilter.sh
    Run individually on each nucleus. Edit input file to ensure grabbing correct version.

addDefinitions.sh
    Adds additional variable definitions to the files. Currently configured to run all 3
    targets for data and both MF and SRC for He. Should be easy to extend to C & D.

fiducialCuts.sh
    Performs fiducial detector cuts

PoverEcutsAll.sh
    Performs p/E cuts on each file (edit CalPoverEcuts.sh file to add C & D simiulation).
    Then performs Emiss & preBCal cuts on each file.

makeAllFigures.sh
    Each of the above scripts returns a tree. This script reads in a tree, and creates the
    figures specified in makeFigsTemp.C. All you have to do is specify the input directory(s)
    where the trees are housed, and it will generate files for all trees (again, need to add D
    & C simulation to output).
