Workflow

dataFilter.sh
    Run individually on each nucleus. Edit input file to ensure grabbing correct version.

addDefinitions.sh
    Only needed to add definitions to simulation files. Data file have most things devined in the filter.C script.
    Adds additional variable definitions to the files.

fiducialCuts.sh
    Performs fiducial detector cuts + a couple others

PoverEcutsAll.sh
    Performs p/E cuts on each file (edit CalPoverEcuts.sh file to add C & D simiulation).
    Then performs Emiss & preBCal cuts on each file.

makeAllFigures.sh
    Each of the above scripts returns a tree. This script reads in a tree, and creates the
    figures specified in makeFigsTemp.C. All you have to do is specify the input directory(s)
    where the trees are housed, and it will generate files for all trees (again, need to add D
    & C simulation to output).
